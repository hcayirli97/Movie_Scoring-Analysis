# Movie_Scoring-Analysis

In this study, datasets in files with parquet extension, which contain information about movies on IMDB, were analyzed. 
Inferences were made from the genres and scores of the films. 
Their data is visualized and presented below.

When the average scores given to the films are examined by separating the films according to the years they were released, it is seen in the chart below that the most successful films belong to the 1920s-1930s.
